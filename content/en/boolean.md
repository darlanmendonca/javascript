## Boolean

The boolean type is very simple, they represent the values `true` and `false`, and we can give decisions with their two states. Imagine a variable who determine if a lamp is on or not. Or a variable what determine if a data is visible or not. Booleans serve to define these states. E.g:

```js
var khalDrogoLive = false;
var khaleesiLive = true;
```

Like we have operators to work with Numbers, we have operators to do comparations, and check if is true or false.
Will see more about conditional operators in a future article, but now see some examples

```js
// > greater than
var heightMountain = 2.06;
heightMountan > 2;
// return true
```

```js
// < less then
var heightMountain = 2.06;
heightMountan < 2;
// return false
```
